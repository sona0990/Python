#Prob 2: Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles.

#If sum of angles is equal to 180, then triangle can be formed, else it can't be formed.

a = int(input("Enter the first angle"))
b = int(input("Enter the second angle"))
c = int(input("Enter the third angle"))
sum = a+b+c
if ( sum == 180 ):
    print ("Triangle can be formed")
else:
    print("Triangle can't be formed")
